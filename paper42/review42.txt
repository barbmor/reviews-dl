The submission is in the category "extended abstract" of a larger paper which seems to be still unpublished.
The paper is in the scope of DL workshop.
It presents an application of description logics in the area of program verification and specifically in the formulation and proving specifications. 
For this task, the description logic is used to describe an intended domain of the program, in a generalization
of Hoare triplets describing program contracts (precondition, action, postcondition).
Not much can be understood from the 4 pages of the abstract. 
The unclear points are listed below.

Detailed comments.

p.1 Abstract: the authors say that they present a calculus, while it is contained only in the long version of the paper, not to be found in the extended abstract.
p.1, line -8: "description logic assertions" suggests ABox statements? Do you use TBoxes and ABoxes?
p.1, line -2. "these assertions are used by a Hoare Logic that operates only on the program state"... But the pairs of domain assertion and program state are now parts of triples, hence the proposed logic (still a hoare logic) works on both of them?

p.3, line 3: "Our aim is to specify..." I wonder if the aim is to specify or to specify and prove the specification, and the latter is even more important?
p.3, eq (1): why there is no post-condition in the program (state) part?
p.3, inference example: It is not clear if one should read it from bottom up or from top to bottom.
p.3, inference example: symbol of entailment with superscript K is not defined.
p.3, line -2: "... to leverage the pragmatics DL to..." not understandable
