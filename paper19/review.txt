The abstract is reporting a very nice result in the area of unification in the description logic EL extended with role hierarchy, transitivity of some roles and cycle-restricted TBoxes.
The contribution is clearly in the scope of DL and should be accepted.

The unification algorithm for EL-problem with a cycle-restricted TBox extended with role hierarchy axioms and transitivity of some roles has already been known.
Likewise the unification algorithm for EL where top is not allowed is also known.
The authors combine these two algorithms to solve a problem in EL  with a cycle-restricted TBox extended with role hierarchy axioms and transitivity of some roles  where the top symbol is not allowed either in the formulation of the problem or in the solution.

The new algorithm is non-trivial and interesting.
It is a step forward in the difficult area of unification in description logics.
The authors hint at an application in maintaining SNOMED ontology which does not uses top concept in its definitions, although it is not clear if a
cycle-restricted TBox component is really needed.
